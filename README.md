 This program calculates sum of numbers from 1 to N using multiple threads, demonstrating the use of structures for passing data to threads and synchronization with mutexes

   It Accepts total number of elements (N) and number of threads as command-line arguments.
   Initializes an array of integers from 1 to N.
   Splits the array across threads, each computing a segment's sum.
   Sums up the partial results from all threads to get the total.
   Verifies the computed sum against the expected formula (N*(N+1)/2).
